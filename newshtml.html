    <h1 class="h1text" >Blown Turbos, Wrecked M3, Epic Slides: Inside Michigan's Drift Scene</h1>
    <img class="driftimg" src="newsimg/drift.jpg">
    <div class="newsptext" >
     <p>
       I talked with the co-founder of Mi drift, Bailey Birr (the other co-founder’s name is Brian Mentz), and he told me the group hosted its very first event in August of 2016 after Birr was inspired by a large drift event he had attended in New Jersey called the East Coast Bash (put on by Club Loose). Birr figured there was no reason why something that awesome couldn’t exist in Michigan.
     </p>
     <p>
      So Birr, who, up to that point, was going to Ohio and Indiana to get his car sideways, invited ten drifting buddies to his home state to get Mi Drift’s early drifting shindigs on their feet. Turnout ever since has been solid, with about 40 drivers attending events, which are usually held at Gingerman Raceway and Auto City Speedway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mi drift has held nine drifting sessions (which usually last from noon until midnight, and cost from $75 to $100 to participate, and $10 to spectate) since Aug. 2016, and has even managed to goad a handful of spectators out of the stands and into the drifting game.

  <h1 class="h1text" >James Deane continues his winning ways</h1>

    <p>
      Long Beach, Calif.– Formula DRIFT Black Magic Pro Championship presented by BlackVue Dash Cameras returned to Evergreen Speedway for the Round 6: Autozone Throwdown. Points leader James Deane once again finishes on top of the podium to increase his lead in the Pro Championship standings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round 6: Autozone Throwdown was a highly competitive event that sets up a two-way battle for the championship between Deane and former Formula DRIFT champion, Fredric Aasbo with only two events remaining in the season. The capacity crowd was kept entertained throughout the event weekend, while the Livestream drew over 1 million views over the course of the weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Year in and year out the fans in the Pacific Northwest have proven to be some of the most diehard drifting fans out there,” said Jim Liaw, President of Formula DRIFT. “This event truly showcased what drifting is all about with the drivers putting on one amazing show for the fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Top 4, number one qualifier and current points leader, James Deane in the Worthouse Drift Team / Falken Tire Nissan 240 faced off against former champion Dai Yoshihara in the Falken Tire / Turn 14 Distribution Subaru BRZ. It was a hard fought battle, but Deane was able to take advantage of an error by Yoshihara to move into the Finals. On the other side of the Top 4 bracket, former champion Fredric Aasbo in the Rockstar Energy / Nexen Tire Toyota Corolla iM faced Aurimas “Odi” Bakchis in the Falken Tires / Drifz Wheels / ARK Performance Nissan 240SX. Aasbo edged out his opponent to face the current points leader in a battle that could effect the rest of the season. Both drivers put it all on the line with the first battle too close to call forcing the judges to call a One More Time. The final battle was also very close, but after deliberation Deane was able to earn the victory to increase his points lead on Aasbo with only two events remaining.

  <h1 class="h1text" >BMW M3 2018 CS</h1>
  <img class="driftimg" src="newsimg/bmwm3.jpg">
  <div class="newsptext">
    <p>
      All you M3 fans can look forward to a quicker, more extreme version of BMW’s sport sedan benchmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our spy photographers this week spotted a lightly camouflaged M3 at the Nürburgring, and some subtle modifications made to the tester suggest that it’s for a new M3 CS model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, BMW seems to be making use of its multiple CS trademark filings which range from “M1 CS” through to “M8 CS.” The first was the M4 CS that BMW unveiled in April at the 2017 Shanghai Auto Show.
